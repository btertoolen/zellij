# Zellij Files

These are my awesome Zellij config files for a setup that looks like this:

- You need to install [zjstatus](https://github.com/dj95/zjstatus) for it to work (or replace it with the regular tab-bar).
- The swap config includes both stacked and vertical layouts, with stacked as the default (it starts stacking when you create the third pane).
- Integrates with **Nushell** for running **Helix** with environment variables.
- Uses **Yazi** as a file explorer, running in a small pane (20% width) within each Zellij tab.
- Other layout examples from Zellij docs are included but commented out.
