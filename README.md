# Zellij Files

These are my awesome zellij config files for a setup that looks like this:

![Zellij (quiet-ukulele) - homelucca cargobinnu_2024-01-20_181936_1687](https://github.com/luccahuguet/zellij-files/assets/27565287/921927ce-2684-4a6d-9051-84016f0d6af6)

But you have to install [zjstatus](https://github.com/dj95/zjstatus) for it to work! (Or you could replace it with the regular tab-bar)
The swap config has both stacked and vertical layouts included, with stacked as the default (it starts stacking when you create the third pane)
